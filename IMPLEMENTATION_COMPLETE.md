## Database Support

All features use existing database tables from migrations:
- `notifications` - Migration 007
- `user_2fa` - Migration 007
- `achievements`, `user_achievements` - Migration 007
- `user_ranks` - Migration 007 (with seeded data)
- `deposits` - Migration 004

---

## Additional Steps Needed

### 1. Seed Achievements Data
The Achievement model includes a `seedAchievements()` method. Run once to populate:

```javascript
// In a migration script or admin tool
const Achievement = require('./models/Achievement');
await Achievement.seedAchievements();
```

### 2. Configure Rank Perks (Optional)
Update rank perks in database for commission multipliers:

```sql
UPDATE user_ranks SET perks = '{"commissionMultiplier": 1.1}' WHERE rank_name = 'Builder';
UPDATE user_ranks SET perks = '{"commissionMultiplier": 1.2}' WHERE rank_name = 'Recruiter';
UPDATE user_ranks SET perks = '{"commissionMultiplier": 1.3}' WHERE rank_name = 'Manager';
-- etc.
```

### 3. Update Platform Wallet Addresses
In `StudentDeposits.jsx`, update the platform wallet addresses:

```javascript
const platformWallets = {
  TRC20: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_TRC20_ADDRESS',
  ERC20: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ERC20_ADDRESS',
  BEP20: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_BEP20_ADDRESS'
};
```

### 4. Automatic Achievement Checking
Consider adding automatic achievement checking:
- After new recruit joins
- After commission earned
- Daily cron job

Example integration:
```javascript
// In referral processing
await Achievement.checkAchievements(userId);
await Rank.checkAndPromote(userId);
```

### 5. Deposit Confirmation (Admin/Instructor)
Add deposit confirmation routes to instructor routes:
- GET pending deposits
- POST confirm deposit
- POST reject deposit
