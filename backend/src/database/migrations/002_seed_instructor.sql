-- Seed Instructor Account
-- Password: InstructorPassword123! (will be hashed by application on first run)
-- This is a placeholder - actual seeding happens in server.js on startup

-- Note: The instructor account is created programmatically by the application
-- on first startup using environment variables:
-- ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD
--
-- This ensures the password is properly hashed with bcrypt
-- and can be changed via environment variables without modifying SQL
